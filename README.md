## Overview

**XtraGPT** is a family of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) designed specifically for **human-AI collaborative academic paper revision**. Unlike general-purpose models that often perform surface-level polishing, XtraGPT is fine-tuned to **understand the full context** of a research paper and execute specific, **criteria-guided** revision instructions. XtraGPT is the refiner of [Friend Project: PaperDebugger](https://github.com/PaperDebugger/paperdebugger)

The models were trained on a dataset of 140,000 high-quality instruction-revision pairs derived from top-tier conference papers (ICLR).
XtraGPT is designed to be easily integrated into agent systems, enabling automatic routing of in-context academic revision tasks (e.g., via skills such as `xtragpt-paper-revision-skill`).

**Key Features:**

* **Context-Aware:** Processes the full paper context to ensure revisions maintain consistency with the global narrative.
* **Controllable:** Follows specific user instructions aligned with 20 academic writing criteria across 6 sections (Abstract, Introduction, etc.).
* **Iterative Workflow:** Designed to support the "Human-AI Collaborative" (HAC) lifecycle where authors retain creative control.

## Training

We use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) for fine-tuning.

### Step 1: Prepare Dataset Configuration

Copy `configs/dataset_info.json` to your LLaMA-Factory data directory:

```bash
cp configs/dataset_info.json /path/to/LLaMA-Factory/data/
```

### Step 2: Run Training

```bash
# Set environment variables
export MODEL_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"  # Base model
export OUTPUT_DIR="./output/xtragpt-7b"        # Output directory

# Run training
bash scripts/train.sh
```

Or use LLaMA-Factory directly:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train configs/train_config.yaml
```

## Evaluation

### Component-wise Evaluation

Evaluates revisions for 6 paper sections: **Title**, **Abstract**, **Introduction**, **Background**, **Evaluation**, **Conclusion**.

Uses modified [AlpacaEval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval) for pairwise comparison.

#### Step 1: Setup AlpacaEval

```bash
# Clone and install AlpacaEval
git clone https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval.git
cd alpaca_eval && pip install -e .

# Copy our modified configs
cp -r ../6_component_evaluation/alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn/* \
    src/alpaca_eval/evaluators_configs/alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn/
```

> **Important:** Replace `glm_winrate.py` in your AlpacaEval installation with our version, which disables the `instruction_difficulty` feature (not applicable to paper revision tasks) and keeps only length bias correction:
>
> ```bash
> cp 6_component_evaluation/glm_winrate.py $(python -c "import alpaca_eval; print(alpaca_eval.__path__[0])")/metrics/glm_winrate.py
> ```

#### Step 2: Convert Predictions

```bash
python 6_component_evaluation/convert_predictions.py \
    --input_dir ./predictions \
    --output_dir ./formatted_predictions \
    --model_name "XtraGPT-7B"
```

#### Step 3: Run Evaluation

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

bash 6_component_evaluation/run_eval.sh \
    ./formatted_predictions/xtragpt \
    ./formatted_predictions/baseline \
    ./eval_results
```

### Full Paper Evaluation

Uses [AI-Scientist](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist) to evaluate entire papers.

#### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist.git
cd AI-Scientist && pip install -e .
```

#### Run Evaluation

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

python full_paper_evaluation/ai_scientist_eval.py \
    --paper_path ./papers/my_paper.pdf \
    --output ./review_results.json \
    --model "gpt-4o"
```

## Paper Revision Benchmark (PyPI Package)

We provide a standalone Python package for benchmarking paper revision models. Install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install paper-revision-bench
```

### Quick Start

```python
import paper_revision_bench as prb

# Prepare your data
samples = [
    {
        "instruction": "Improve the clarity of this title",
        "input": "A Study of Neural Networks",
        "output_1": "Deep Learning for Image Classification",  # Model A output
        "output_2": "Neural Network Analysis Study",           # Model B output
    }
]

# Run evaluation with GPT-4-Turbo as judge
results = prb.evaluate(
    samples=samples,
    judge="openai/gpt-4-turbo",
    criteria="clarity"
)

print(f"Model A win rate: {results.win_rate:.1%}")
```

### Using Paper-Specific Prompts

To reproduce the exact evaluation from our paper:

```python
from paper_revision_bench import get_paper_eval_prompt, list_paper_sections

# Available sections: title, abstract, introduction, background, evaluation, conclusion
print(list_paper_sections())

# Get the evaluation prompt for a specific section
prompt = get_paper_eval_prompt("title")
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Evaluate from JSON file
paper-revision-bench evaluate \
    --input samples.json \
    --judge openai/gpt-4-turbo \
    --criteria clarity \
    --output results.json

# List available criteria and judges
paper-revision-bench list-criteria
paper-revision-bench list-judges
```

### Supported Judges

| Judge             | Model ID                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GPT-4-Turbo       | `openai/gpt-4-turbo`                   |
| GPT-4o            | `openai/gpt-4o`                        |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` |
| Local Ollama      | `ollama/llama3`                        |
| vLLM Server       | `vllm/model-name`                      |

For advanced usage (length-controlled win rate, weighted overall score across sections), see the [package README](paper_revision_bench/README.md).

## Inference with Transformers

To use XtraGPT with the standard Hugging Face `transformers` library, ensure you format your input using the specific tags `<PAPER_CONTENT>`, `<SELECTED_CONTENT>`, and `<QUESTION>`.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Select the model size: "XtraGPT-1.5B", "XtraGPT-3B", "XtraGPT-7B", or "XtraGPT-14B"
model_name = "Xtra-Computing/XtraGPT-7B"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto"
)

# Define the Prompt Template tailored for XtraGPT
prompt_template = """Act as an expert model for improving articles **PAPER_CONTENT**.
The output needs to answer the **QUESTION** on **SELECTED_CONTENT** in the input. Avoid adding unnecessary length, unrelated details, overclaims, or vague statements.
Focus on clear, concise, and evidence-based improvements that align with the overall context of the paper.
<PAPER_CONTENT>
{paper_content}
</PAPER_CONTENT>
<SELECTED_CONTENT>
{selected_content}
</SELECTED_CONTENT>
<QUESTION>
{user_question}
</QUESTION>"""

# Example Data (from the "Attention Is All You Need" paper)
paper_content = "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train."
selected_content = "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration."
user_question = "help me make it more concise."

# Format the input
formatted_prompt = prompt_template.format(
    paper_content=paper_content,
    selected_content=selected_content,
    user_question=user_question
)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": formatted_prompt}
]

# Apply chat template
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)

model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# Generate
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=16384,
    temperature=0.1
)

generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

## Production Usage (OpenClaw Integration)

XtraGPT can be used as a **specialized academic writing backend** in agent systems such as OpenClaw, Cursor, or custom research workflows.

Unlike general-purpose LLMs, XtraGPT is optimized for **high-precision, context-aware paper revision**, and is best used as a **dedicated revision module** that is automatically invoked when needed.

### Install via NPM

We provide an official OpenClaw integration package:

```bash
npm install xtragpt-paper-revision-skill
npx xtragpt-paper-revision-skill init
````

This will scaffold the required **provider**, **skill**, and **routing rules** into your project.

> ⚠️ Prerequisite: You must first serve a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible XtraGPT endpoint (e.g., via vLLM, SGLang, or Ollama).

After installation, configure your endpoint:

```bash
export XTRAGPT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8088/v1
export XTRAGPT_API_KEY=dummy
```
---

### Quick Setup

To integrate XtraGPT into your system:

1. Serve XtraGPT locally (e.g., via vLLM, SGLang, or Ollama)
2. Register it as a model provider (OpenAI-compatible endpoint recommended)
3. Add the `xtragpt-paper-revision-skill` skill
4. Enable routing rules for academic editing

👉 The system will then **automatically dispatch paper revision requests to XtraGPT**, with no special prompting required.

---

### How It Works

In a typical workflow:

```text
User request
   ↓
Agent router detects "revision intent"
   ↓
xtragpt-paper-revision-skill skill
   ↓
XtraGPT
   ↓
Revised academic text
```

---

### Example Requests That Auto-Route to XtraGPT

"Rewrite this motivation paragraph so it clearly reflects the research gap stated in the abstract."

"Revise this introduction to better align with our claimed contributions and avoid inconsistency."

"Improve this paragraph by incorporating the experimental findings mentioned later in the paper."

"This section sounds fluent but unconvincing, strengthen the argument using the paper’s overall narrative."

"Make this contribution paragraph more precise and ensure it matches what we actually evaluate in Section 4."

"Reduce overclaim in this paragraph while keeping it aligned with the evidence presented in the paper."

---

### When to Use XtraGPT

Best suited for **instruction-driven, in-context revision tasks**, such as:

* aligning a paragraph with the paper’s overall narrative (e.g., abstract, contributions, or results)
* revising content to satisfy specific writing criteria (e.g., strengthen motivation, reduce overclaim)
* ensuring consistency across sections (e.g., introduction ↔ evaluation ↔ conclusion)
* refining rebuttals using evidence grounded in the paper

Not intended for:

* open-ended conversation or brainstorming
* coding or debugging
* factual Q&A or retrieval tasks

In practice, XtraGPT should be used **alongside a general LLM**, not as a replacement.

---

### Why Not Use a General LLM?

General-purpose LLMs typically operate at the **local text level**, which leads to:

* fluent but **unconvincing or misaligned revisions**
* weak handling of **cross-section dependencies**
* limited ability to follow **structured writing criteria**
* tendency to introduce **overclaim or generic phrasing**

---

### What XtraGPT Does Differently

XtraGPT is trained for **controllable, context-aware revision**, enabling:

* revisions grounded in the **full paper context**, not just local text
* alignment with **explicit user instructions and writing criteria**
* consistent argumentation across sections
* more **defensible and academically faithful** outputs

---

### Recommended Usage Pattern

```text
General LLM → drafting / reasoning  
XtraGPT     → in-context revision / alignment
```
